3. How It Works (Workflow)

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Sensing & Perception
Sensors collect data from the environment (e.g., road, objects, humans).


2. Data Processing & Sensor Fusion
Combines inputs from different sensors for a unified view of the surroundings.


3. Localization & Mapping
Determines the vehicleâ€™s/robot's exact location using GPS + SLAM.


4. Planning
Plans the route and trajectory to reach the target while avoiding obstacles.


5. Decision Making
Uses AI to determine the best actions (e.g., speed up, turn, stop).


6. Control Execution
Sends commands to actuators to control movement (steering, throttle, brakes).


7. Feedback Loop
Continuously updates sensor data and adjusts behavior accordingly.

4. Data Collection

Types of Data Collected

Visual Data: From cameras (used for object detection, classification)

Distance/Depth: From LiDAR, radar (used for obstacle detection)

Location Data: GPS + IMU for positioning

Behavioral Data: Vehicle dynamics (speed, acceleration), user interaction

Environment Data: Weather, road conditions, traffic data


Storage & Processing

Onboard Storage: Edge devices store data locally

Cloud Storage: Data offloaded for analysis and model training

Real-time Processing: Critical data is processed on the fly for safety
