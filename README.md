Autonomous Vehicles

2.Self-driving capability: Navigate without human intervention.

3.Obstacle detection and avoidance: Identify and maneuver around obstacles.

4.Lane-keeping and navigation: Stay within lanes using GPS and cameras.

5.Adaptive cruise control: Adjust speed based on traffic.

6.Traffic sign and signal recognition: Detect and respond to road signs and lights.

7.Emergency braking: Stop automatically to avoid collisions.

8.Environmental awareness: Understand surroundings in real time.


Robotics

Autonomy: Operate independently or semi-independently.

Path planning: Determine efficient movement paths.

Object manipulation: Pick, move, and interact with objects.

Sensor integration: Use vision, touch, and audio sensors.

Human-robot interaction: Communicate with humans using speech or gestures.

Mobility: Wheels, legs, or flying capability for movement.



2. TECHNOLGIES USED

1.Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Decision-making, learning from data.

2.Machine Learning (ML) – Improves performance by analyzing patterns.

3.Computer Vision – Processes visual data from cameras.

5.LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) – Creates 3D maps of surroundings.

5.Radar – Detects objects and their speed/distance.

6.GPS & GNSS – Provides location data.

7.IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) – Measures motion and orientation.

8.Sensor Fusion – Combines data from multiple sensors for better accuracy.

9.SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) – Builds a map while tracking the robot’s location.

10.Edge Computing – Processes data on-device for faster decisions.

11.Actuators and Motors – Control movement.



3. HOW ITS WORK

In Autonomous Vehicles

1. Perception: Cameras, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensors scan the environment.


2. Localization: GPS and SLAM help the vehicle know its exact position.


3. Path Planning: AI calculates a safe route to the destination.


4. Control: The system sends signals to brakes, steering, and throttle to follow the planned path.


5. Decision Making: AI reacts to traffic, signs, pedestrians, and other vehicles in real-time.



In Robotics

1. Sensing: Sensors detect surroundings, obstacles, and task-related objects.


2. Mapping and Localization: SLAM or predefined maps help the robot understand where it is.


3. Planning: Algorithms determine what actions to take (e.g., move, pick up object).


4. Actuation: Commands are sent to motors or robotic arms to execute the task.


5. Feedback loop: Sensors continuously update the robot, allowing it to adjust its action


   

4. TYPES OF DATA COLLECTED 

Visual Data: From cameras (used for object detection, classification)

Distance/Depth: From LiDAR, radar (used for obstacle detection)

Location Data: GPS + IMU for positioning

Behavioral Data: Vehicle dynamics (speed, acceleration), user interaction

Environment Data: Weather, road conditions, traffic data

Storage & Processing

Onboard Storage: Edge devices store data locally

Cloud Storage: Data offloaded for analysis and model training

Real-time Processing: Critical data is processed on the fly for safety
